            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap 
            into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum 
            passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

          <p>HTML & CSS are the programming languages that tell a web browser how it 
            should display the visual elements of a web page. While basic, they are some 
            of the world's most commonly used programming languages. All modern web pages 
            are built off of a base of HTML & CSS, so anyone looking to develop web applications
            will need to learn these languages. In this overview, youâ€™ll learn more about
            what HTML & CSS is, what they can do, who uses them, and how to understand 
            them to add this skill to your professional toolbox.</p>
